A symbol mangling regime for the Fanhacker’s Toolkit

In my experience dealing with the compilation of a wide variety of assets
for games on the Nintendo Game Boy Advance, I have found it exceedingly
helpful to have a predictable naming scheme for the symbols pointing to the
compiled assets while programming.

In the same spirit of dualistic documentation provided in Aquefir’s slick
repository, mangledeggs attempts to provide a symbol mangling scheme that
is useful in the various proprietary formats used in asset sources, while
still being friendly to the proclivities of identifier rules in ANSI C. In
short, it is for both humans and machines.
